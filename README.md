##VPN
A virtual private network extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network.

>It has been observed that once ppp0 VPN is connected, then only private IPs of that private network can be accessed. This script is designed to resolve this issue. Now, you can access internet even connected to internet.
